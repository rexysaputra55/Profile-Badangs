    <h2><em>Background</em></h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><p>
        Long ago there was a small village, surrounded on all sides by water, which was resting in the southern regions of the Land of Dawn. The villagers were very hardworking, fishing day and night for a living. Among them was a strong man, a mighty warrior, named Badang. It was said that Badang could lift a kart full of firewood, with just one arm. He has a great sense of justice and a heart full of courage.
        Badang was known for fighting beasts who seemed a threat to his village. Enthusiastic and brave, he tirelessly helped everyone solve their difficulties in life.
        One day, a strange thing happened in the peaceful village, not long after.
      </p></dt>
      <dt><p>
        The villagers got up early on the day to catch loads of fish. However, in the evening, they returned empty-handed, and even the tools for fishing were broken. Everyone was upset and overcome with panic, thinking it was the curse of a mystical water monster. As food supplies ran low, Badang decided to give them a hand to find out the truth, since he did not believe in the stories of the water monster.
        In the early morning, Badang went out to fish, as usual. He came to the river near the village to set up a fishing trap. He not only placed a lot of fish, but also hid it with a giant fishing net, prepared in advance, trying to find out who or what was causing all this trouble. Shortly after, the river suddenly began to roll, a strange creature lurking within the river appeared next to his trap. Devil-like and fearsome, it began to gobble the fish and destroy his trap. It's eyes were fierce, with long hair and a slimy octopus structure.
      </p></dt>
      <dt><p>
        Badang decisively threw a giant fishing net, trying to trap the monster. However, the monster pierced the fishing net with its giant blade-like teeth and broke free. It constantly attacked him, but the fearless Badang jumped into a battle against this fearsome beast, without any hesitation. The power of this monster was surprisingly strong and Badang's arms were severely injured in the bloody battle. When the beast was about to devour Badang, he used his all his remaining strength and pierced a fishing spear into it's eye, and then dragged the monster to the river shore. After leaving the river, the monster gradually lost its moisture and began to dry. It was struggling to breathe. Badang had never seen such a creature and was somewhat surprised at it.
        He noticed a magical gem sparkling within it's body.
      </p></dt>
      <dt><p>
        Struggling to speak, the water monster begged Badang to let it go, swearing it was an elf who lived within the river but had suffered a horrible transformation. Once the beast headed to the southern mountains to prey on fishes, it accidentally ate fishes caught by the fisherman, corrupted by hunger and evil energy. As it spoke, Badang kindly freed it off the spear's pain, advising it to seek a pure life. Touched by this kindness, the beastâ€™s body gradually began to change. The water beast began to regurgitate all the fish it had consumed, along with the evil energy. Having returned to it's natural state, the water elf deeply appreciated Badang.
       After that, he blessed Badang with a stream of powerful energy and not only was his injured arms restored but they had become way more overwhelmingly powerful than before. Badang's kind heart drove him to finally let go of the monster. Badang started helping the villagers day and night, whose lives slowly returned to normal. However, Badang couldn't let go of the southern mountains that the monster spoke of. For the safety of his village, Badang was determined to find the source of this evil energy, within the mountains and traveled across the islands, and into the Land of Dawn.
